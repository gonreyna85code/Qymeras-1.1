# Qymeras 1.1 Progress Tracker

## Current State (updated 2026-08-30)

- **Branch `main` = CODE FREEZE / PRODUCTION BASELINE.** HEAD `77606f4`
  carries NO AI code (`ai.cpp`/`ai.h`, `sensors::aidig`/`aiana`, QMAI EEPROM
  block all removed). Deterministic core intact, builds green on 3 envs, host
  suite 45/45, unified `Qymera::` public API.
- **Branch map:** 1.1 = `main` (frozen) · 1.2 = `feature/GUI` → integration
  candidate on `backup/gui-main-merge-20260830` (override) · Dashboard/AI =
  `feature/ai-experiments` + future (separate direction, kept out of 1.1/1.2).
- **Fleet (2026-08-30):** both boards flashed with the 1.2 integration
  candidate (`fe20e7f`) and live. ESP8266 = **192.168.1.16** (device_uid
  12014147; DHCP drifted from .19 after the GUI reflash, taking the ESP32's old
  lease) — 12 local entities, all endpoints healthy. ESP32 = **192.168.1.19**
  (device_uid 183646728) — 12 local entities, healthy. Full mesh cross-visible:
  each node reports 11 remote entities of the other. OTA flags off.
- **Remaining before the production gate (all hardware-required):** 24h memory
  soak, factory-reset hw test, longer endurance, ESP32-C3/S2/S3 hw validation.
- **AI subsystem:** authorized (see `AGENTS.md` "Scope Change Authorization
  2026-08"), developed ONLY on `feature/ai-experiments`. LLM tool-loop experiments
  against the device API (`qwen3.5:2b`/Ollama probe payloads) were cleaned from
  the repo root on 2026-08-27 (archived to a workspace-external backup); they
  are not part of the 1.1 tree.

- [x] Persistence reliability (EEPROM/Preferences) ✅
- [x] Automation deterministic execution ✅
- [x] Networking resilience (UDP/ESP-NOW) ✅

- [x] OTA controlled behavior ✅
- [x] Useful logging verification ✅
- [x] Graceful failure/recovery patterns ✅
- [x] Controlled memory usage ✅ (risks documented)
- [x] UDP discovery batching ✅ (batch TX ≤29 sensors/datagram, RX drain ≤8/tick/socket, RX buf 1400B; hardware-validated on ESP8266+ESP32: same remote set both nodes, idempotent re-announce, no drops/duplicates/growth)
- [x] Discovery persistence fix ✅ (loadCalibration/applyPersistedStates deferred to first report, ensureTimeRegistered() before load, pers_state snapshot on persist enable; TIME correction restores; dual-build green)
- [x] Discovery TEMP-DEBUG logs removed ✅
- [x] Remote config CORS fix ✅ (Access-Control-Allow-Origin on all responses incl. 401/429) + rate limiter burst allowance (6 req/2s, no more 429 on UI two-call flows)
- [x] `/rules/set` `logic` param honored ✅ (1=AND, 0=OR; default OR). Verified on ESP32: logical_and reflected in GET /rules
- [x] Remote config mirrored over mesh ✅ (protocol v5: Packet 47→58 B adds fade/persist/pers_state/pulse/pulse_ms; legacy v3/v4 packets still parsed). Verified: remote RELAY0 persist=true seen from both nodes, remote DIMM0 fade=5000 mirrored
- [x] STEP 1 Production Hardening ✅ (code + builds + host tests; hardware flash/verify pending)
  - Timezone semantics: runtime clock stays UTC; SENSOR_TIME `correction` = offset minutes from UTC; UTC→local via `epoch + offset*60` + `gmtime()` (portable ESP8266/ESP32, no libc TZ globals); dead `time_offset` removed
  - ESP-NOW RX FIFO: bounded 8x250B ring (single-producer callback, single-consumer loop), ESP32 portMUX critical sections, callback never blocks/logs, `rx_overflow` counter + warn log in `mesh::tick()`
  - `/calib/set` strict validation: `parseStrictFloat` rejects empty/trailing-junk/overflow/NaN/Inf; timezone integer -720..840; fade/pulse 0..3600000 ms; persist/avail strict 0/1
  - `isVirtual()` error handling: 5s timeout + `response.ok` check + network-error alerts; optimistic UI toggles roll back; never falls back to the local node
  - platformio.ini: espressif32 pinned `@6.5.0`, new `esp32c3_devkit` env (esp32-c3-devkitm-1)
  - Host tests: `tests/host_sanity.py` (45 checks: timezone conversion, strict float parsing + ranges, ESP-NOW FIFO incl. wrap-around/overflow) — 45/45 pass
  - Builds green: esp8266_generic, esp32_devkit, esp32c3_devkit (no warnings in project sources)
  - PHASE 6 remote lifecycle BLOCKER fix: intermittent ESP32 full-loop spin after ESP8266 reboot
    - Symptom: ESP32 main loop saturates (~30k-42k "New remote sensor 'DIMM0'"/s), `millis()` logs freeze,
      UDP/mesh/web/OTA/automation tick starved, WiFi recovery blocked until self-clearing (~1-10s).
    - Root cause: `WiFiUDP::parsePacket()` re-yielded a datagram that `read(buf, 1400)` returned valid data
      for but did **not** dequeue (ESP32 WiFiUDP socket quirk under WiFi-transitional state). The tick had no
      progress guard, so the undrained datagram looped forever. Oversized/invalid packets could also wedge it.
    - Fix (`src/mesh.cpp::parseUDPPacket`): (1) reject+drain oversized packets (`packet_size > sizeof(buf)`);
      (2) `if (len <= 0) { drain; break; }` to escape unreadable transitional datagrams; (3) **unconditional
      post-parse drain** `while (socket.available()) socket.read();` to guarantee dequeue and break re-yield.
      No change to normal (valid, fully-read) datagram path — drain is a no-op there.
    - Validation: 4x ESP8266 reboot stress + 1x ESP32 clean-boot (post-fix) = 0 storm lines; ESP8266 report
      interval silenced mid-test confirmed ESP8266 is NOT a flood source; ESP32 clean-boot re-acquires 11
      remotes idempotently (no phantom growth). Both builds green (esp8266_generic, esp32_devkit).
    - Status: fixed + hardware-validated (was BLOCKER; cleared for re-test).

## GUI Stabilization Pass (feature/GUI, 2026-08-30)

Target: Qymeras 1.1 web GUI on branch `feature/GUI`. Not firmware logic —
front-end/UI contracts only. All changes verified by 3-env build matrix.

### Root causes found
1. **Modal never displays** — `.modal` / `.modal.open` overlay CSS was dropped
   when `.content` CSS was added (`33a5be2`); only `.modal-content` remained, so the
   Automation wizard rendered as a plain unstyled block instead of an overlay dialog.
2. **Logs page unstyled + crash-prone render** — no `.log-grid/.log-panel/.log-entry`
   CSS; `e.v.toLowerCase` missing `()` so severity classes were never applied and
   echo'd the function body; no handling for non-array/invalid/missing-field data.
3. **Double tab init** — `web.cpp sendStartupJS` injected `show(savedTab)` before the
   later `<script>` blocks were parsed (functions undefined → ReferenceError, unhandled
   rejection), then the end-of-bundle IIFE ran `show()` a second time.
4. **Relay persistence UI regressed to DOM state** — `togglePersist`/`togglePulse` read
   `#pulseRow<i>` `style.display` / `classList.contains('on')` instead of `sensors[i]`;
   `togglePersist` always sent `persist=1` (could never disable persistence).
5. **Filter empty states de-scoped** — `document.querySelector('.empty.sm')` global;
   Devices and Settings filters could remove each other's empty state.
6. **Wizard save-time validation never aborts** — `forEach(...){ alert(); return; }` returns
   from the callback only; invalid level/action still POSTed to `/rules/set`.
7. **`sendDimmer` and wizard still used `alert()`** — task requires toast-only errors.
8. **Rule list / empty states unstyled** — `.rule-card`, `.rule-info`, `.empty`, `.d-none`
   CSS missing; `#auto_empty` had a duplicate `class` attribute.

### Files changed
- `src/html.cpp` — CSS (modal overlay, logs grid/panels/entries + severity colors,
  rule cards, `.empty`/`.d-none`); Logs markup (Clear button + `#logStatus`); i18n keys
  (es/en `btn.clear`, `log.*`, `dev.noMatch`, `cfg.noMatch`); rewritten
  `refreshLogs`/`renderLogs` + new `showLogStatus`/`clearLogs`; single tab-init IIFE;
  scoped filter empty states; model-driven `togglePersist`/`togglePulse`/`toggleRelayAvail`
  + `updateRelayUI`/`setPersistence`; model sync in `toggleMatterSwitch`; error handling in
  `toggleDevice`; `sendDimmer` alert→toast; `finishWizard` validation now aborts correctly
  (alert→toast); `loadRules` renders readable action strings.
- `src/web.cpp` — `sendStartupJS` sets `window.startupTab` (single init); new
  `POST /logs/clear` endpoint → `logger::clearBuffer()`.

### Behavior now
- `show()` visibility via `.content.active` only; one `show()` on load from
  `window.startupTab` (AP mode forces `config`).
- Modal visibility via `.modal.open` only; overlay close + Escape preserved.
- Log messages rendered with `textContent`, layers CORE/EVNT→panels, level `inf/wrn/err`
  colors, defensive per-entry parsing, 200-entry cap/panel, empty-state placeholders,
  `#logStatus` line (updated time+count / HTTP error / invalid JSON / network error),
  Clear button calling the new endpoint.
- Relay persist/pulse/avail toggles read `sensors[]`, enforce mutual exclusion,
  keep DOM in sync from the model.
- Filter empty states scoped to `#devices_cards` / `#cards`; `textContent` (no i18n HTML).
- No `alert()` left in the GUI (all toasts).

### Test matrix (builds)
| Env | Status |
|-----|--------|
| esp8266_generic | PASS (RAM 69.8% / Flash 46.9%) |
| esp32_devkit | PASS |
| esp32c3_devkit | PASS |

Remaining: hardware flash + on-device UI walkthrough (logs clear/refresh, modal,
relay toggles, wizards, filters) — not performed in this pass.

## Final Fix + Size-Reduction Pass (feature/GUI, 2026-08-30)

Merged final pass on top of the stabilization work above. Goals: close the
remaining functional bugs (toast i18n), remove confirmed dead code, unify
duplicated sensor formatting, cut unnecessary network/DOM work, and shrink the
embedded web payload — all without changing feature behavior or appearance.

### Functional fixes
- **Toast texts showed raw keys**: `tf('alert.failed')` and `tf('alert.saveError')`
  were used by `toggleRelayAvail`/`isVirtual`/`updateRelayUI` but the keys did not
  exist in `I18N` (es/en) → toasts rendered the literal key. Added
  `alert.failed` and `alert.saveError` in both languages.
- **Dead `saved` notice**: `location.search` `saved=1` branch targeted a
  `#savedNotice` element that no longer exists (and `saved.notice` i18n keys).
  Removed the dead branch + keys.
- **Health badge duplication**: `loadDevices()` rebulids sensor state every control
  poll; the poll also re-computed the `#systemHealth` badge → moved badge update
  into `loadDevices()` (runs on boot + every control poll) and removed the copy.

### Dead code removed (each verified 0-referenced first)
- `renderAutomationTable()` (`editRule(i)` array-index version) — `loadRules()`
  renders `#auto_table`; `newRule()` kept.
- `getTotalSteps()` / `getStepNumber()` (wizard) — the wizard indexes via
  `getRelevantSteps()` directly in `showStep()`/`nextStep()`.
- `availableSensors` duplicate of `sensors`. `sensorByIndex()` now reads the
  shared `sensors` cache; `loadSensorsAndActuators()` calls `getCalib(false)`
  (no per-wizard-open `/calib` fetch when cached).
- CSS: `.card`, `.notice`+`.notice.success`, `.dash-section`, `.time-value`,
  `.gradient-bg` (3 rules — `input[type=range]` already styles sliders),
  `.dot.warn`; unused slider `class="gradient-bg"` attr.
- i18n keys (es+en): `title`, `stat.updated`, `rule.condition`,
  `rule.actuators`, `alert.isVirtualTimeout`, `saved.notice`.

### Consolidations (no behavior/appearance change)
- New shared `formatSensorValue(type, value, state)` used by `deviceCard`,
  `updateSettingsValues` and the wizard step-2 condition list, replacing three
  byte-identical TEMP/HUMI/PRESS/LEVEL/LUMI/AIRQ/RAIN/CONTACT/GENERIC chains
  (removed `SENSOR_DISPLAY` map).
- New `calHead(label, s, i)` settings-card header helper; 6 duplicated
  `settings-card-head` blocks (AIRQ/RAIN/CONTACT/DIMM/REL + `sensorCalibCard`)
  now render via the shared helper.

### Reduced runtime work
- 5s poll now tab-gated: `config` → `updateSettingsValues()` (cached); `control`
  → `loadDevices()` (fresh); `auto/logs` → nothing. Previously every 5s while
  visible the GUI rebuilt the (possibly hidden) device DOM and fetched `/calib`
  regardless of tab.

### Server trim (verified: 0 GUI references)
- `/calib` response no longer emits unused `pers_state`, `min`, `max`, `pin`,
  `last_update` per sensor (smaller JSON on every poll; `age_ms`/`correction`
  retained — both are read by the GUI).

### Size results
Embedded web payload in `src/html.cpp` (PROGMEM chunks):

| Chunk | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Styles | 19,889 | 18,845 |
| Tabs | 18,293 | 18,035 |
| Rules | 1,495 | 228 |
| CardsSettings | 9,819 | 8,159 |
| DeviceCards | 5,805 | 5,496 |
| JS | 27,261 | 26,369 |
| AutoWizJS | 33,863 | 32,053 |
| **Total** | **116,425** | **109,185** |

Saved **7,240 B (6.22 %)**. `html.cpp` file 116,936 → 109,696 B.

### Verification
- Extracted GUI JS syntax-checked with `node --check` (PASS, incl. `°C` UTF-8
  integrity) and leftover-grep scan for every removed symbol (0 hits).
- Build matrix (no ESP32 flash — in use by a parallel branch test):
  esp8266_generic PASS (RAM 69.7% / Flash 46.2%); esp32_devkit + esp32c3_devkit
  compile+link PASS (not flashed).
- **Hardware verification (ESP8266, 2026-08-30):** flashed COM9 (`pio run
  --target upload`, 486,816 B, hash verified) → clean boot, WiFi 192.168.1.19,
  heap 18,384 B. Live checks: `/` HTTP 200 (page 109,535 B; new helpers
  `formatSensorValue`/`calHead` present, dead symbols `renderAutomationTable`,
  `availableSensors`, `SENSOR_DISPLAY`, `gradient-bg`, `getTotalSteps`,
  `savedNotice` absent; `alert.failed`/`alert.saveError` keys live in es/en);
  `/calib` 12 sensors with `age_ms`+`correction` and NO
  `pers_state/min/max/pin/last_update`; `/logs` returns boot entries normally.
## Search inputs: fix + styling (2026-08-30)
- Root cause: `loadDevices()` (5 s tab poll) and `loadCalib()` rebuilt their
  whole container `innerHTML`, recreating the `#devSearch` / `#settingsSearch`
  inputs every time → cursor/focus loss and an auto-applied filter on each poll
  ("solo enters" themselves).
- Fix: inputs moved OUT of the rebuilt containers into static markup
  (`#devices_cards` gains static `#dash_stats`, `.search-box`, `#dash_lists`;
  config gains a static `.search-box` before `#cards`). Because they are never
  re-rendered, focus/cursor persist across polls.
- Filtering split: `filterDevices()`/`filterSettings()` read the input and
  store the APPLIED term; `applyDeviceFilter()`/`applySettingsFilter(term)`
  re-apply the applied term after a list re-render. Polls no longer read the
  input value, so a half-typed query is never auto-triggered.
- Placeholder i18n: inputs use `data-i18n-ph` extended in `setLang()` (es/en).
- Styling: added `.input-sm` rule (border-radius `var(--radius-sm)`, border
  `var(--border)`, bg `var(--bg-2)`, focus ring) — the class previously had no
  CSS at all, hence inputs had square unstyled corners.
- Payload 109,185 → 109,392 B (+207 B). `node --check` PASS. Build + flash
  esp8266_generic SUCCESS (flash this round: 2026-08-30). Live `/` 200
  (109,810 B) — single `#devSearch`/`#settingsSearch`, no auto-read of inputs,
  `.input-sm` rule present.

## Audit completion (2026-08-30)
- `src/mesh.h` reviewed (last unread source file): no GUI dead code.
  `min`/`max`/`pers_state` are real protocol v5 `Packet`/callback fields used by
  the firmware — consistent with dropping them from `/calib` JSON only (JS
  never read them). `PACKET_VERSION=5`, batch/MTU and RX-drain caps documented.
- All endpoints exercised live at 192.168.1.19: `/rules` 200 empty array,
  `/ota/status` 200 `{ota}`, `/` 200. `window.genset` confirmed injected by
  `web.cpp:sendStartupJS()` before the script so the DEFAULT settings card
  renders its broadcast/command/interval values (no `genset` ReferenceError).

## Interactive headless walkthrough (2026-08-30) — ALL PASS
Drove the live GUI at 192.168.1.19 via Edge `--headless=new` + CDP
(WebSocket, Node 24). Every check green; **0 uncaught exceptions /
console.error** across the whole session.

- **Load/control:** 22 device cards, 3 stat cards, health badge "12".
- **Search focus vs 5 s poll (user-reported bug):** REAL mouse click focuses
  `#devSearch`; node identity stable across poll (input never recreated);
  focus still on the input after the poll; partial typing ("abc") intact;
  `devSearchTerm` stays "" — poll does NOT auto-apply the filter. Apply hides
  all in a `__NO_MATCH__` query + shows `empty.sm`; clear restores.
- **Config:** 14 settings cards; DEFAULT kv (ports/interval) renders via
  injected `window.genset`; accordion toggles block↔none; settings filter
  hides all + empty state; `updateSettingsValues()` yields live metrics (28),
  no NaN/undefined; timezone select present.
- **Automations:** empty state visible (`auto_empty` display:flex); wizard
  modal opens; step 0 shows the 4 rule types; ALL 6 dynamic steps render
  without exception; closes.
- **Wizard selections:** sensors list = 4 for EDGE type (types [7,6,9,12]),
  actuators = `[9] RELAY0` + `[10] DIMM0`; actions ON/OFF/TOGGLE (+ LEVEL only
  for the dimmer). NOTE: `showStep(4)` lands on the *actions* step when logic
  step is skipped for single-sensor rules (`steps=[0,1,2,4,5,6]`) — correct
  dynamic indexing, not a bug.
- **Dimmer slider:** `onDimmerInput` updates the value read-only (0→42→0)
  without sending GPIO writes (test was read-only on purpose).
- **Logs:** 9 entries across panels on `logs` tab, status "Actualizado…".
- **Language toggle:** ES→EN→ES; nav relabels and `#devSearch` placeholder
  becomes "Search..." (`data-i18n-ph` works).
- **Toasts:** success/error render and auto-dismiss (~3 s).

Conclusion: no remaining functional gaps in the GUI 1.1 final pass on the live
device. Working tree clean, branch `feature/GUI` up to date.

## FINAL FREEZE AUDIT (2026-08-30) — feature/GUI
- HEAD `978d430` + this audit: working tree clean; existing GUI treated as
  baseline. Explicitly no redesign / no new features / no refactor.
- Builds: esp8266_generic PASS (RAM 69.7% / Flash 46.2%), esp32_devkit PASS,
  esp32c3_devkit PASS (compile-only; ESP32 flash stays with the parallel branch
  test). Rebuilt + reflashed ESP8266 after the CSS cleanup and re-verified live.
- JS: `node --check` PASS on the exact served script block.
- Functional verification (live, Edge headless + CDP, post-cleanup):
  control renders 22 cards + stats + health; desktop layout `grid` @1280 px /
  mobile list `grid` @400 px; config renders 14 cards after reload; zero
  runtime errors. Full interactive walkthrough (search focus vs 5 s poll,
  wizard, logs, ES/EN, toasts, dimmer read-only) already green this session.
- CSS audit: `.dot.warn` absent from CSS and never referenced in markup/JS →
  not needed (warn is conveyed textually and via `.toast.warning`/`l.wrn`).
  `.l.inf`/`.l.wrn` flagged by a naive scan are runtime-generated
  (`'l ' + level`) → kept. All `var(--…)` referenced are defined.
- **Trivial safe fix applied:** removed two empty CSS rules (`.pages{}`,
  `.devices-dashboard{}`) → no visual effect, payload 109,392 → 109,362 B.
  (An intermediate edit that briefly dropped the `.devices-desktop-layout`
  base rule was caught and fully restored; live re-verification confirms the
  responsive layout grid/none toggling works.)
- README updated for accuracy: tab list corrected (no standalone NETWORK tab —
  it is a Settings card; LOGS tab added), mesh datagram counts clarified
  (v4 ≤29 / v5 ≤23), bilingual UI + freeze status noted.
- Final `html.cpp`: **109,873 B** file, **109,362 B** payload.
- Freeze verdict: SAFE TO FREEZE. Remaining known limitations (unchanged):
  ESP32 hardware/soak tests pending; THRESHOLD without hysteresis (use
  cooldown); TIME/INTERVAL no catch-up after reboot; HTTP only (no HTTPS/CSRF);
  `.toast.warning` defined but currently never triggered (no warn paths); Auth
  gate dormant by design.

## API SIMPLIFICATION — `Qymera::` public facade (2026-08-30)

Moved the whole user-facing API under a single `Qymera` namespace so `main.ino`
only needs to spell out `Qymera::`. Renames:

| New public API (namespace `Qymera`) | Previous |
|---|---|
| `Qymera::init()` (user hook) | `void initSatellite()` |
| `Qymera::report()` (user hook) | `void report()` |
| `Qymera::onCommand(uid,type,value,state)` (user hook) | `void onCommandHook(...)` |
| `Qymera::begin()` / `Qymera::loop()` | `core::begin()` / `core::loop()` |
| `Qymera::temperature/humidity/luminosity/level/pressure/airQ/rain/custom/contact/relay/dimmer(...)` | `sensors::xxx(...)` |
| `Qymera::setRelay()`/`handleToggle()`/`handleDimmer()`/`startFade()`/`calibrate()`/`getCalib()`/`rtc()`/`ntp()` | `sensors::xxx(...)` |
| `Qymera::setSerialEnabled()` / `Qymera::isSerialEnabled()` | global `setSerialEnabled()` / `isSerialEnabled()` |

How it was done (low risk):
- `Qymera.h` exposes the library-provided facade as **inline wrappers** that
  forward to the untouched internal `core::`/`sensors::` layers (no behavior
  change, internal calls unchanged).
- User hooks are declared in `core.h` under `namespace Qymera` (core is the
  caller); **implemented by the sketch** (`void Qymera::init() {...}`, etc.).
- `core.cpp` call sites updated: `Qymera::init()`, `Qymera::report()` (x2),
  and both `::initSatellite()`/`::report()` globals removed.
- `log.h`/`log.cpp`: `setSerialEnabled()`/`isSerialEnabled()` moved into
  `namespace Qymera` (no internal users; only the Base example called it).
- Sketches updated: `src/main.cpp`, `examples/Base/Base.ino`,
  `examples/HardwareDemo/HardwareDemo.ino` (minimal helper comments).
- Docs updated: `README.md` (Quick Start sketch + Supported Sensors table),
  `structure.md` (module table + integration flow), `docs/architecture-baseline.md`
  (init order + serial note).

Validation: `pio run` full link green on 3 envs — esp8266_generic RAM 69.6% /
Flash 42.2%, esp32_devkit, esp32c3_devkit. Host suite unaffected (no API
reference in `tests/host_sanity.py`). No firmware behavior changed: the facade
is a compile-time rename; hooks are called at the exact same points.

## CODE FREEZE / PRODUCTION BASELINE (2026-08-30)

`main` (HEAD `c714e37`) is **frozen as the Qymera 1.1 production baseline**.

Freeze audit results:
- **Builds (clean, full recompile of the 3 envs):** esp8266_generic ✅ RAM
  69.6% / Flash 42.2%, esp32_devkit ✅, esp32c3_devkit ✅. Full link SUCCESS
  on all. ESP8266 revalidated on device after reflash.
- **Host suite:** `python tests/host_sanity.py` → **45/45 PASS**.
- **Warnings (project, pre-existing, accepted — no blocker):**
  `storage.cpp:163/166` sign-compare on `String::length()` (harmless bounded
  write loops); `web.cpp:20/21` `AUTH_USERNAME`/`AUTH_PASSWORD` unused
  (dormant auth gate by design, documented limitation). Framework-only
  warnings (elf2bin.py escapes, ESP32 hal-uart `return`) are out of our build.
- **No stale AI code in `main`:** verified `src/` has no `ai.*` sources and no
  `aidig`/`aiana`/`QMAI` references.
- **Live node (ESP8266 @ 192.168.1.16, build c8daf16):** `/` 200, `/calib` 200
  (12 entities, UID-slot persistence), `/rules` 200 (`[]`), `/logs` 200
  (clean boot: Credentials/Settings loaded, WiFi connect, heap 18464 B),
  `/ota/status` 200 (flag off). Web/API + persistence verified on hardware.
  (UDP/discovery, automations, OTA upload: hardware PASS already recorded in
  the FINAL VALIDATION TABLE; no functional code changed since.)
- **No code changes during this freeze audit** — no blockers found.

Pending (hardware-ONLY, does not block the code freeze):
1. 24h memory soak (sustained mesh + web polling).
2. Factory-reset hardware test (`/factory` → credentials/rules/calibration
   cleared, back to `QymeraSetup` AP).
3. Longer storage-endurance cycles (100-cycle test passed; ≥1000 pending).
4. ESP32-C3 / ESP32-S2 / ESP32-S3 hardware validation (build-verified only).
5. Note: ESP32 (device_uid 183646728) currently offline — its family
   validation is pending hardware presence.

Verdict: **SAFE TO FREEZE as Qymera 1.1.** Any subsequent GUI work will move
to `feature/GUI` (1.2); Dashboard/AI stays on `feature/ai-experiments`.
